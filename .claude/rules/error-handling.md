# Error Handling Rules

- Before building on any input, verify it against the source. Do not assume inputs are correct because they are familiar or plausible.
- Correctness is the first gate. Review output for accuracy before improving clarity or presentation.
- Check internal consistency: values, statuses, and judgments within the same output must agree with each other. If one part contradicts another, resolve before presenting.
- Every claim must be grounded. When a value, status, or judgment appears alongside supporting data, verify they agree. Check against the source, not your own fluency.
- Correct errors found during self-review before presenting.
- If the reviewer catches an error the producer missed, name the error and identify what check would have caught it. That check becomes a convention.
- All changes to existing definitions, terms, or structures must be announced as explicit, reviewable line items before implementation.
