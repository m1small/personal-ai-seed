# Saplings

A sapling is a Personal AI seed with some branches already growing. Where the seed gives you the trunk and lets you grow everything from scratch, a sapling gives you a head start in one or more life domains.

## What's in a Sapling

Every sapling includes the complete seed as its foundation — processes, schemas, governance, conventions. On top of that, a sapling adds some combination of:

- **Agent templates** — Pre-defined roles with decision rules, ready to customize
- **Data store structures** — Empty stores with headers and registry entries, organized by domain
- **Schema extensions** — Domain-specific structural definitions
- **Process additions** — Ways of working proven in the domain
- **Tool contract templates** — Integration guidance for domain-relevant tools
- **Certification templates** — Knowledge base outlines for the domain

What a sapling does **not** include: personal data, credentials, personas, or domain-specific certifications that contain proprietary knowledge. Those are yours to build — the sapling gives you the structure.

## How to Use a Sapling

1. **Clone the sapling repository** — each sapling is its own repo
2. **Open it in your AI coding tool** — Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically; other tools use `prompts/bootstrap.md`
3. **Have the planting conversation** — the sapling still triggers the planting conversation (your glossary hasn't been written yet). The conversation is extended with a "Tour the Branches" phase where your AI walks you through what's pre-built
4. **Customize** — connect your tools, add your domain knowledge, build your persona
5. **Use it** — switch to Execution Mode and let the pre-built agents work for you

The planting conversation is still the first thing that happens. A sapling doesn't skip personalization — it extends it. You still name your own terms. You just also get a guided tour of what's already growing.

## How to Create a Sapling

If your tree has grown branches that would help others get started, you can extract a sapling. Follow the Sapling Production process in `processes.md`.

The key principle: **generalize, don't copy.** Replace your personal data with empty structures. Replace your credentials with setup guidance. Replace your specific domain knowledge with templates. Keep the structural decisions — the schemas, the data organization, the agent roles and decision rules — because those are what took time to discover.

Each sapling definition lives in this directory as a markdown file following the Sapling Schema (`schemas/sapling-schema.md`). The definition is metadata — the sapling itself is a separate repository.
